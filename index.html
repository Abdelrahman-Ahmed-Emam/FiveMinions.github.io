                    <p>Stuart is playful, friendly, intelligent and funny. He is skillful at video games like his friend Dave. He can also be the most sincere and innocent out of all the minions. He also seems to have a rebellious and obstreperous attitude. He is considered to be a slacker among the other Minions, preferring to chill out and play the ukulele than listen to the rules. Also, he was said to be always hungry in Minions, such as when he attempted to eat Kevin and Bob when he was thinking of them as bananas, and even tried to sing a yellow fire hydrant in New York, thinking that it was a female minion.</p>

He has a very high respect for Gru and even believes he is the greatest villain in the world, but he often doubts his abilities and motives. He is also quite eccentric with rather bad hearing due to his age, but although he seemed a little odd at times, he did not seem to be going senile.</p>

He is dressed up as a baby as he went with Mark and Tim, dressed as a dad and a mom, to the store. While they couldn't find a toy, Phil gave Agnes a toy unicorn that he made out of other materials they bought at the store, and received a kiss from her. </p>

                    <p>Agnes, like her sisters, wished to be adopted by someone who cared about her. At first, Agnes is only one out of the three sisters to be excited to be adopted by Gru. She happily hugs his leg and plays games with him, while her sisters are gawking at Gru, their dream of the 'perfect parents' in tatters. She is unaware of Gru's own dislike of the whole adoption, her innocence prevailing. She is a very naive, sweet, and innocent child, which is why Margo is so protective of her. She thinks Gru's "dog" is cute and chases after him, despite some protest from Margo.</p>

                    <p>Margo tends to be a sensitive and straight to the point girl who is very untrusting of people as she takes a long time to warm up to Felonius Gru and she also does not trust his minions to begin with. She is quite optimistic despite her difficulty trusting people, telling the girls that they will be happy with Gru eventually</p>

                    <p>She shares many traits with Gru, being very destructive, tomboyish and sporting a macabre sense of humor. In the beginning, she is reserved and quiet - being opposed to the idea of being an adopted child. Upon seeing all of Gru's weapons and torture devices, her dark, destructive nature is shown when she nonchalantly walks into an iron maiden and starts playing with Gru's dangerous weapons in his lab. She breaks glass bottles with foreign substances in them,</p>

                    <h3>Lucy Wilde</h3>
                    <p>She seems to be quite alert at times, as shown when Gru tried freezing her with his freeze ray, when she quickly (albeit casually, as though done a number of times before) countered this attack with her flamethrower. Lucy is also very athletic and skilled in combat, demonstrated when she accidentally knocked a tray of cupcakes and managed to strike every single one, with "a combination of jiu-jitsu, Krav Maga, Aztec warfare, and krumping!" although she accidentally flung the remainder of the cupcakes at Gru. She is also shown being a great athlete when she fights Eduardo's guard chicken, El Polito.</p>

            <p class="text">(Bello tropa), we are the 5 Minions, let me present our team. We are 5 students in the faculty of engineering AinShams, major mechatronics (Shahd, Mariam, Abdelrahman, Khaled and Helal). We were asked to invent a kids' game as our course project. In this website you will be able to read and see everything about our journey and the result of our hard work to make this game interesting, safe, and helpful to the current generation.
                And for now (poopaye).
                N.B: the words between the parentheses are from the minions language you can search up to know the meaning.</p>
